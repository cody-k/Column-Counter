# Column Counter
### This program requires that Numpy be installed. 
A python program that takes a text file/text file path as an argument and counts the number of unique numbers in each column using '-' as a delimiter. <br>


## Run the python script in command prompt i.e: <br> 
`py columncounter.py textfile.txt` <br>
`python columncounter.py textfile.txt` <br>
<br>
`py columncounter.py C:\Users\XXX\Documents\textfile.txt` <br>
`python columncounter.py C:\Users\XXX\Documents\textfile.txt` <br>
<br>
## An easier way to run this script is to simply: <br>
1. Open `command prompt` (if you are on windows simply hit `Windows Button + R` and type `cmd` and hit `enter`) <br>
2. Type `py` or `python` into the command prompt <br>
3. Drag and drop the `columncounter.py` file into the window to load the file path <br>
4. Hit space, and drag and drop the `text file` you wish to read to load its file path<br>
5. Hit Enter to run
